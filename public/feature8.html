            <h1>Feature 8 — Sureeporn Apaikawee</h1>

            <p>
                I am an IT student at Canadian College of Technology and Business (CCTB), 
                currently building a strong foundation in software development and systems fundamentals.

                <h2>About My Knowledge</h2>

                <p>
                    My learning journey focuses on programming basics, object-oriented concepts, databases, 
                    Linux system basics, and DevOps-related practices. Through hands-on projects, assignments, 
                    and continuous practice, I am developing problem-solving skills and 
                    learning how real-world systems are designed and tested.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This space represents my growth as a beginner in IT, where I document what I’m learning, explore new technologies, 
                    and gradually prepare myself for real-world projects and future roles in the tech industry.
